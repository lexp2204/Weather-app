# 🌤️ Weather App *Learning Based 

> I designed and developed a simple weather web application using React.js, Node.js, and Express.js. This application was a learning based project to help me practice fetching real-time data dynamically from OpenWeatherAPI using a frontend and backend framework.
> The design was made using Figma.
